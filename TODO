- Added customizable User Agent header, default is python-xcaplib-version 
- Add sip: before user@domain to the XUI in each request
- Make it work in async mode, urllib is blocking
- even after asked for password, xcapclient still sends request without authorization first
- fix parsing of command line arguments which are currently overwritten with
  data from the configuration file; use a proxy attribute which first verifies
  the command line and then fallbacks to the configuration file
